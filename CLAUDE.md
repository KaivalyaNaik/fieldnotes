# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

v0.1 ships all three tools: `get_recent_deploys` (GitHub Actions backend), `tail_logs` (Grafana Cloud Loki backend), and `check_alerts` (Alertmanager backend). Source lives in `main.py`, `backends.py`, `github_actions.py`, `loki.py`, `alertmanager.py`, `service_map.py`, and `models.py`, with tests under `tests/` and packaging via `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`. The README documents the operator UX.

## What this is

`fieldnotes` is a minimal **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** for on-call engineers. It exposes three read-only tools that answer the first three questions during an incident: what shipped, what are services saying, what alerts are firing.

## Common commands

uv-based; no Makefile or task runner.

- `uv sync --all-extras --dev` — install runtime + dev deps.
- `uv run pytest` — full test suite. CI runs the same command (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- `uv run pytest tests/test_github_actions.py::test_map_status` — single test by name.
- `uv run pytest -k service_map` — tests matching a substring.
- `uv run python main.py` — start the MCP server on stdio. Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPO` (see `.env.example`).

No linter or formatter is wired in.

## Architecture

`main.py` is a FastMCP server that delegates to a backend behind a Protocol. Non-obvious wiring:

- **Backend seam.** `backends.py` declares the `DeploymentBackend` Protocol and a `build_deployment_backend()` factory keyed on `FIELDNOTES_DEPLOY_BACKEND`. Adding a new deploy source (ArgoCD, Spinnaker, etc.) is a new module implementing the Protocol plus a new branch in the factory — don't rewire `main.py`.
- **Lazy backend init.** `main.py` constructs the backend on first tool call, not at import. Missing env vars surface when a tool runs, which keeps module import and tests cheap.
- **Resolve-then-validate ordering** in `github_actions.py:get_recent_deploys`: `service` is resolved through the optional service map *before* the workflow-stem regex check. Logical map keys may contain spaces; only resolved stems must match `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`. Reversing this order rejects legitimate logical names like `"my service"`. Tests in `tests/test_github_actions.py` pin the ordering — read them before refactoring this path.
- **Service map all-or-none.** Once `FIELDNOTES_SERVICE_MAP` (or `_FILE`) is set, every `service` arg must be a key — names that previously passed through verbatim are rejected. The README has the full operator UX; the `_FILE` form is `.json` only, and setting both env vars at once raises at startup.

## Architectural constraints (load-bearing)

These come from the README's "Non-goals" section and should shape every implementation decision:

- **Read-only.** No mutations of any kind — no restarts, rollbacks, scaling, alert silencing. If a proposed feature would write to a backend, it doesn't belong here.
- **No metric queries.** Alerts are in scope; raw PromQL / arbitrary metric queries are not. The boundary is: "is this firing?" yes, "what's the p99 over 24h?" no.
- **Pluggable backends, BYO credentials.** The server does not proxy auth or manage credentials — it reads from whatever backend the operator configures. Design tool implementations behind a backend interface so the deploy/log/alert source can be swapped (e.g., GitHub Actions vs. ArgoCD, Loki vs. CloudWatch, Alertmanager vs. PagerDuty).
- **Single-tenant.** One server, one operator. Don't add multi-tenancy, request-scoped auth, or per-user config.
- **Three tools, read-only, Protocol-backed, single-tenant.** Resist abstractions, frameworks, and config layers that don't serve those four constraints — the value is in the constrained surface area.

## Tool contracts

The three MCP tools and their signatures are fixed by the README:

- `get_recent_deploys(service, limit=10)` → deploy ID, status, who, when, commit SHA
- `tail_logs(service, lines=100, since="15m")` → recent log lines within a time window
- `check_alerts(severity=None, service=None)` → currently firing alerts, optionally filtered

When implementing, preserve these names, parameters, and defaults unless the user explicitly asks to change them.
